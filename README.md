# ‚ú®Warp

This short powershell script addresses a recurring issue I face when programming : **slow navigation to frequently used directories**.

**Warp** lets you assign an alias to a directory in your file system, to speed up the navigation to this directory.

## Usage

*Create a warp*

```powershell
/path/to/my/project $ warp set myProject
# ‚ú® Added warp 'myProject' here.
```

*Navigate to a warp*

```powershell
/another/location $ warp to myProject
# ‚ú® Warped to myProject.
# Now, the current working directory is /path/to/my/project
```

*List all registered warps*

```powershell
$ warp list
# üìñ Registered warps
# 
# 'myProject' ‚û°Ô∏è /path/to/my/project
# 
# Total: 1 warps.
```

*Remove a warp*

```powershell
$ warp remove myProject
# ‚úÖ Removed warp
```


## Installation

This script requires Powershell (**>= 7.1**) in order to be executed.  
Don't forget to set powershell's **execution policy** to `RemoteSigned` (see [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.5))  

You can either clone the project, or simply download the `warp.ps1` file.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Don't forget to add the the script to your PATH variable.

## Future improvements

- Remove the necessity of the `to` keyword when navigating to a warp. This syntax should become possible: `warp myProject`
- Implementation in `bash`. For now, warp requires Powershell to be installed on your system.
- Unit testing
